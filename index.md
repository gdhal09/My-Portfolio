>The aim here is to build a multiple linear regression model for prediction of demand for shared bikes for a US bike-sharing service provider, **BoomBikes**. The business goal here is to understand the various factors resulting in dip in demand for the bike-sharing services post the pandemic and manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customerâ€™s expectations.
